## 🧑‍💻 Advanced Algorithms for MCA Students

### Welcome to my GitHub repository for advanced algorithms, designed specifically for MCA students at DYP International University! In this repository, you'll find implementations of various algorithms, including sorting, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

## 📜 Algorithms

Here are the algorithms currently available in this repository:

🚀 Quick sort

🧩 Merge sort

🌲 Prim's algorithm

🧮 Matrix Multiplication

👸 N-Queen problem

🎨 Graph coloring

🏗️ Tower of Hanoi

🎒 Knapsack problem

🚚 Traveling salesman problem


Each algorithm has its own directory, containing a Python implementation, a sample input file, and a README with usage instructions and explanation of the algorithm.

## 💻 Usage
To use these algorithms, simply clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to the directory of the algorithm you want to use, and run the Python file with the provided input file. The README in each directory will provide more detailed instructions.

### 🤝 Contributions
I welcome contributions to this repository! If you'd like to add an algorithm, improve an existing implementation, or fix a bug, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the contribution guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.

### 📚 Resources
