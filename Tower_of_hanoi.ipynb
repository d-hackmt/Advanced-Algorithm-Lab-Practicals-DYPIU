Begin by labeling the pegs as A, B, and C.\n","\n","2. Number the disks from 1 to n, with the smallest disk being 1 and the largest disk being n.\n","\n","3. Initially, all the disks are stacked on peg A in order of size, with the smallest disk on top and the largest disk on the bottom.\n","\n","4. To solve the puzzle, we recursively move the top n-1 disks from peg A to peg B using peg C as an intermediate peg, and then move the remaining largest disk from peg A to peg C.\n","\n","5.
