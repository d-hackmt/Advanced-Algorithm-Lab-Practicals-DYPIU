For merge sort, the problem is to sort an array of elements. The algorithm first divides the array into two halves, then recursively sorts each half, and finally merges the two sorted halves to produce a fully sorted array.\n","\n","#### To sort the array, we divide it into two halves, then we recursively sort each half by applying the same merge sort algorithm. We keep dividing each half until we reach a point where the sub-array has only one element. A sub-array with one element is already sorted, so we return it as is.\n","\n","#### Once we have sorted the two halves, we merge them back together to create a fully sorted array. We compare the first element of each sub-array and add the smaller one to a new array. We repeat this process until we have added all the elements from both sub-arrays to the new array.\n","\n","#### By using the divide and conquer strategy to recursively divide and sort the input array and then merge the sorted sub-arrays, merge sort can sort an array of any size in O(n log n) time, making it a very efficient sorting algorithm."],"metadata":{"id":"cbjJvcnF48mk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## PYTHON CODE"],"metadata":{"id":"R5I6aibT5JzX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
